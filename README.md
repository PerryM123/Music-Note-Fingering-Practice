# Music-Note-Fingering-Practice

### Goal:
1. To display which notes to play on the screen (PWA)
2. By the end of this, the user should be able to know where each key on the saxophone (or whatever instrument) is
3. To get the user used to playing the notes on the saxophone

### User can:
- Choose the speed between each note (10 secs for each card? 5 sec for each card?)
- Can select from a list of notes they wish to be displayed



### Technology:
- React
- React Router
- Redux? Sagas?
- PWA

### Future:
-Backend (Express.js)

### Things to do:
-Add styling with styled-components
-add interfaces
-So that I can implement the which keys to turn on or off in the settings, make it so:
1. keyNote: {on: true, “A flat”}
